# Basics of Linux in Cybersecurity

A static blog / cheatsheet by a junior cybersecurity-oriented engineer — collecting real Linux and network labs, shell scripting, and security-relevant command-line work.  
The site is ready to deploy on GitHub Pages (no frameworks, pure HTML/CSS/JS).

## What is this

- Purpose: to gather and document my early Linux and networking labs — from basic commands through Bash scripting, IP/network configuration, firewall rules, to network scans with Nmap.  
- Audience: anyone starting out in cybersecurity, pentesting, system administration, or wanting a clean but real-world-driven Linux reference.  
- Why it matters: in security work, knowing how to navigate, inspect, and manipulate a Linux system from the shell is often the first step — this blog shows what I actually did, not only theoretical lists.
